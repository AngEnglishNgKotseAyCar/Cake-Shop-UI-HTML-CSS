# Cake-Shop-UI-HTML-CSS
A simple UI I built for my Web Dev 1 midterm project using HTML and CSS. Completed in October 2024. 
==============================================================================================================================================
Hi! I made this UI while trying to figure out a lot of things, sorry if it seems too monochrome. Please feel free to play with your own code copy!! The project was themed on pastries 🍞🧁, so I decided to go for cakes 🍰 and use a lot of sweet emoticons 🍬 as part of the lesson coverage.
